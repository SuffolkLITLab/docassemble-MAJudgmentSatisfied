question: |
  Petition to Deem Judgment Satisfied
subquestion: |
  This form asks the court to officially mark your eviction judgment as satisfied because you already paid what you owe. Once the judgment is marked satisfied, it is easier to show future landlords or credit screeners that you resolved the case.

  **You are in the right place if:**

  * The case was for nonpayment of rent
  * A judgment entered against you
  * You paid the full judgment amount (including any agreed interest or costs)

  Massachusetts General Law [Chapter 239, Section 16(k)](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleIII/Chapter239/Section16) gives you this right.

  **Before you start, grab:**

  * Your court papers with the docket number
  * Proof of payment (receipt, money order stub, bank record)
  * The mailing or email address for the plaintiff or their attorney

  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert" style="border-left: 4px solid #5bc0de; padding: 15px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep all of these documents nearby so you can finish the form without pausing mid-way.
